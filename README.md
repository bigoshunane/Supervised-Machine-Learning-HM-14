# Credit Risk Analysis

## Background
LendingClub is a peer-to-peer lending services company that allows individual investors to partially fund personal loans as well as buy and sell notes backing the loans on a secondary market. LendingClub offers their previous data through an API.
You will be using this data to create machine learning models to classify the risk level of given loans. Specifically, you will be comparing the Logistic Regression model and Random Forest Classifier.

## Project Objective
The aim of this project is building a machine learning model that attempts to predict whether a loan from LendingClub will become high risk or not.

## Data Source
LendingClub (2019-2020) Loan Stats retrieved from: https://resources.lendingclub.com

## Steps and Results

### 1. Loading data source

### 6.2 Create Random Forest Classifier for the scaled data

## 7. Conclusion

### 7.1 Random Forest Classifier
For unscaled data, the scores for the Random Forest Classifier Model:

    . Training Score: 1.0
    . Testing Score:  0.6180348787749894
      
For scaled data, the scores for the Random Forest Classifier Model:

    . Training Score: 1.0
    . Testing Score:  0.6193109315185028

From the scores above, the Random Forest Classifier won't be very efficient in predicting the Credit Risks. The differences between the scores on the scaled and unscaled data are almost identical; hence, the difference is negligible.
 
### 7.2 Logistic Regression Model
For the unscaled data, the scores for the Logistic Regression:

    . Training Data Score: 0.6485221674876848
    . Testing Data Score:  0.5253083794130158
For the scaled data, the scores for the Logistic Regression:

    . Training Data Score: 0.713136288998358
    . Testing Data Score:  0.7201190982560612
    
From the scores above, the best model to predict the Credit Risk is the Logistic Regression on the scaled data. The training scores and testing scores are much more closer than the unscaled data; hence, giving more confidence to make a more accurate prediction.
Therefore, in conclusion, Logistic Regression will be a better model to use.
